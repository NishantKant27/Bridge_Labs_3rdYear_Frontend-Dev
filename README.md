🖥️ #Frontend Development Journey

Welcome to my Frontend Development Learning Repository!
This repository documents my daily progress and learnings as I build a strong foundation in Web Development — covering HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap so far.

📘 #HTML

We explored the following concepts in HTML:

Block and Inline Elements

Attributes, Headings, and Paragraphs

We started with an Introduction to CSS, covering:

Selectors, Colors, and Backgrounds

Box Model, CSS Units, Border-boxing

Inline, Block, Inline-block Elements, and Layout Positioning

🧠 Hands-on Practice:
Design a simple webpage using internal and external CSS — applying background colors, margins, padding, and element positioning.
